The importance of data modification and transformation was underlined in this project. 
It is critical to select appropriate procedures based on the nature of your data and your research aims. 
Working on this project proved Pandas' power for data cleaning, aggregation, and merging. 
Dealing with incomplete data and determining the best JOIN method were among the difficulties. 
In the future, I would prioritise code optimisation and smoothly managing larger datasets.
