# Assignment-5

The importance of data modification and transformation was underlined in this project. It is critical to select appropriate procedures based on the nature of your data and your research aims. Working on this project proved Pandas' power for data cleaning, aggregation, and merging. Dealing with incomplete data and determining the best JOIN method were among the difficulties. In the future, I would prioritise code optimisation and smoothly managing larger datasets.

Features

Data Selection: The code reads from an Excel file the customer and order data.
Data Transformation: It uses the pandas library to execute data transformations such as JOINS and aggregations.

Data Visualisation: Although it is not specifically stated, the modified data can be utilised for visualisation.

View Creation (Simulated): The code uses pandas DataFrame to generate a view-like structure.

Usage
This repository should be cloned to your local system.
Put your Excel file with customer and order information in the repository directory.
Modify the code to specify the correct Excel file directory and sheet names.
Execute the code to complete the data transformation and view construction.
Examine the printed results and use the converted data as needed.

Note
This code does not require a complete database setup. It simulates data processing processes and view development using pandas DataFrames. Consider customising the code to interact with an actual database for real-world use.
